# Project Context

- **Owner:** Brady
- **Project:** squad-sdk — the programmable multi-agent runtime for GitHub Copilot (v1 replatform)
- **Stack:** TypeScript (strict mode, ESM-only), Node.js ≥20, @github/copilot-sdk, Vitest, esbuild
- **Created:** 2026-02-21

## Learnings

### From Beta (carried forward)
- Zero-dependency scaffolding preserved: cli.js vs runtime separation
- Bundle size vigilance: every dependency is a cost, every KB matters
- Distribution: GitHub-native (npx github:bradygaster/squad), NEVER npmjs.com
- esbuild for bundling, tsc for type checking — separate concerns
- Marketplace prep: packaging for distribution, not just local use

### 📌 Team update (2026-02-22T041800Z): Publish workflows verified ready, versions aligned to 0.8.0, both packages published to npm — decided by Rabin, Kobayashi, Coordinator
Rabin verified existing publish workflows already correct — no changes needed. Both SDK and CLI workflows properly configured for npm. Kobayashi aligned all versions to 0.8.0. Coordinator published @bradygaster/squad-sdk@0.8.0 and @bradygaster/squad-cli@0.8.0 to npm registry. Distribution infrastructure production-ready. Release workflows validated end-to-end.
