### Name-Agnostic Testing Pattern
Tests reading live .squad/ files (team.md, routing.md) must assert structure/behavior, not specific agent names. Names change during team rebirths. Two classes of tests: (1) live-file tests — must survive rebirths, use property checks, (2) inline-fixture tests — self-contained, can hardcode names. See ralph-triage.test.ts for the canonical pattern.

### Dynamic Content Discovery
Blog tests in docs-build.test.ts use filesystem discovery (readdirSync) instead of hardcoded arrays. Adding/removing blog posts no longer requires updating the test. Pattern: discover from disk, sort, validate build output exists.

### Test Baseline (Post-v0.8.24)
3,931 tests passing, 46 todo, 5 skipped, 149 test files (~89s). Only failure: aspire-integration.test.ts (needs Docker daemon). Speed gates in speed-gates.test.ts enforce UX budgets (help output <100 lines, init <10s, etc.).

### Command Wiring Regression Test
cli-command-wiring.test.ts prevents the "unwired command" bug: verifies every .ts file in packages/squad-cli/src/cli/commands/ is imported in cli-entry.ts. Bidirectional validation — also checks that every import points to an existing file.

### CLI Packaging Smoke Test (v0.8.24 Release Assessment)
cli-packaging-smoke.test.ts validates the PACKAGED CLI artifact (npm pack → install → execute). Tests 27 commands + 3 aliases by invoking them through the installed tarball. Catches: missing imports (MODULE_NOT_FOUND), broken package.json exports, bin script misconfiguration, and ESM resolution failures. Gate runs before both SDK and CLI publish jobs. Complements cli-command-wiring.test.ts (source-level import verification) by testing the artifact users actually download. All 32 tests passing (37s runtime). Approved for v0.8.24 release gate.

📌 **Team update (2026-03-08T21:18:00Z):** FIDO + EECOM released unanimous GO verdict for v0.8.24. Smoke test approved as release gate. FIDO confirmed 32/32 pass + publish.yml wired correctly. EECOM confirmed 26/26 commands + packaging complete (minor gap: "streams" alias untested, non-blocking).
